# hello-world
standard first git hub repo practice 

Hello github, it's taken me forever to actually make a repo on here even though I have had an account for over two years. I am currently a senior in my computer science program. I work as a development intern for a small startup where I get to do some really cool stuff. I started writing in HTML and CSS about three years ago and took off from there, I moved to java the c++ and now mostly c#. Although I am about to graduate I still don't know pracically anything about JavaScript, angular.JS, node.JS, PHP, JSON, etc so that's what I am tring to get more comfortable with right now.
